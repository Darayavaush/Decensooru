# Decensooru
Addon userscript for [Better Better Booru](https://github.com/pseudonymous/better-better-booru) v.8.0+ for revealing hidden content on Danbooru.

**Update 2020.7.16**: the fucking assholes broke us once again, this time intentionally. Hang tight while I think up a solution.

## Usage
1. Install decensooru.user.js (gm4 version if you have Greasemonkey 4 on FF57+, normal one for any other combination (including Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey)).
2. Install better-better-booru.user.js, after uninstalling the currently installed script if necessary.
3. Enable the 'placeholder' options for all desired hidden content in BBB settings.

Decensooru occasionally (including upon the first start) pulls update batches and stores them in localstorage. You will be notified when this happens by a text box in the top right corner. Your browser may freeze for up to 30 seconds when the full batch is pulled (this only happens upon the initial load and when you're severely out of date). When it is done, refresh any pages and magic should happen. If anything remains hidden, it's likely not in a batch yet. Retry tomorrow and fap to something else in the meantime. If any post older than a day is still hidden, something went wrong and you should contact me.
